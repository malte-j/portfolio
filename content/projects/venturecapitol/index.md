To make navigating the German legal systems easy for founders, some friends and I founded Venture Capitol, a platform for managing your founding process. We were winners of the Google Cloud Hackathon 2022, thanks to the automated serverless infrastructure I built. We open-sourced the project and accept PRs to keep the content up-to-date.
