Founding a company in Germany is quite a cumbersome process. To make it easier for new founders to find their way through the German legal system, some friends and I founded Venture Capitol, a platform for managing the steps for founding your company. We were one of the winners of the Google Cloud Hackathon 2022, thanks to the automated serverless infrastructure I built. After failing to secure further investment, we open sourced the project and accept PRs to keep the content up-to-date.
