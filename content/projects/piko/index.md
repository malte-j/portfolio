The first iteration of my text editor, Piko. The special thing about it is that it stores the current text in the url in a compressed form, so you can bookmark your the page you're working on and access it later using only that. Share the URL with everybody, without a byte of it getting stored on a server. It also works offline as it's a fully featured PWA.
